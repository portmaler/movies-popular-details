# Movie MVVM App

This is a simple Android app that showcases popular movies using the MVVM architectural pattern. It uses the [The Movie Database (TMDb) API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to fetch movie data.

This project was inspired by the YouTube tutorial [Watch the Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R5j7xMXjM8&list=PLRRNzqzbPLd906bPH-xFz9Oy2IcjqVWCH&ab_channel=OXCoding).
